# CemuManager
This is a simple script I made for managing Cemu on Linux. Currently this script only allows opening and updating Cemu *For the compiling method, will not work on pre compiled veriants* but future options will be coming soon including mlc01 management. This script was tested on Manjaro but should work on any distro.
This script also relys on the fact of you stored Cemu in the Home directory. If you do not have it there you will need to change the paths inside the script untill I have a way to allow the user to set paths within the script
