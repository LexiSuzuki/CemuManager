# CemuManager
!!This script is cuurrently broken because im dumb.
But I am in the proccess of making a native Linux and MacOS version that will have a GUI as well as some usfull stuff i have planed

This is a basic script I made to help you build and use Cemu on Linux based distros and MacOS.
To use simply launch StartCM.sh in your terminal of choice and follow the on screen options to guide you along the script.
It's important to run the dependency setup as this is important to build Cemu as well as set up the build eniorment on MacOS.
MacOS support is still early and this script is desighned with ARM based macs in mind *as I only own an M2 mac so yeah*
And Linux support is limited to Arch based distros for dependency setup, tho if you have them the build should work on any distro
For info on Cemu please visit there official Github on https://github.com/cemu-project/Cemu
