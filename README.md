# CemuManager
This is a simple script I made for managing Cemu on Linux. Currently this script only allows opening and updating Cemu *For the compiling method, will not work on pre compiled veriants* but future options will be coming soon including mlc01 management. This script was tested on Manjaro but should work on any distro
